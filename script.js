        “Through poetic connections feeling is heightened and the spectator is made more active. 
        He becomes a participant in the process of discovering life, unsupported by ready-made 
        deductions from the plot or ineluctable pointers by the author. He has at his disposal 
        only what helps to penetrate to the deeper meaning of the complex phenomena represented 
        in front of him. Complexities of thought and poetic visions of the world do not have to 
        be thrust into the framework of the patently obvious. The usual logic, that of linear 
        sequentiality, is uncomfortably like the proof of a geometry theorem. As a method it is 
        incomparably less fruitful artistically than the possibilities opened up by associative 
        linking, which allows for an affective as well as a rational appraisal. And how wrong it 
        is that the cinema makes so little use of the latter mode, which has so much to offer. 
        It possesses an inner power which is concentrated within the image and comes across to 
        the audience in the form of feelings, inducing tension in direct response to the author’s 
        narrative logic.”

        “Everything depends on how extensively artists sense this responsibility within themselves. 
        How can one demand this of others! Even the smallest demand would be indiscreet. Therefore 
        I think that it makes sense to talk about something related, yet a bit different: the role
        of art in contemporary life. Of course, it's very clear that in our time art finds itself
        in a state of deep depression. This is not something that depends upon various social 
        conditions and circumstances, or on the public's lack of interest. The roots of this problem 
        lie elsewhere. For the public is interested in art, and artists search for the path and 
        possibility of communicating with the public, yet both public and artist suffer from 
        insufficient contact and insufficient potential for interaction. Those who are closely 
        connected with art understand these problems. Apparently, the problem is that art is 
        becoming less and less spiritual. It has already set its sights on something completely 
        different, and this is not something it needs to seek out or strive for. And to a large 
        degree, this hinges on the public, which in the end influences that which transpires in 
        art.”

        “As I see it then, if you stand on firm moral ground there is no need to shy away from 
        greater freedom in your choice of means. Moreover, that freedom need not necessarily be
        restricted to a clear plan which obliges you to choose between certain methods. You also
        have to be able to trust solutions which present themselves spontaneously. Obviously it 
        is important that these should not put the audience off by being overcomplex. This, 
        however, is not something to be gauged by deliberations about what devices to ban or allow
        in your film, but through the experience gained by looking at the excesses that found their
        way into your early productions and which have to be eliminated naturally as your work 
        proceeds.”

        “Time and memory merge into each other; they are like the two sides of a medal. It is 
        obvious enough that without Time, memory cannot exist either. But memory is something 
        so complex that no list of all its attributes could define the totality of the impressions
        through which it affects us. Memory is a spiritual concept! For instance, if somebody 
        tells us of his impressions of childhood, we can say with certainty that we shall have 
        enough material in our hands to form a complete picture of that person. Bereft of memory, 
        a person becomes the prisoner of an illusory existence; falling out of time he is unable
        to seize his own link with the outside world—in other words he is doomed to madness. As
        a moral bring, man is endowed with memory which sows in him a sense of dissatisfaction. 
        It makes us vulnerable, subject to pain.”

        “Audiences have become more discerning in their attitude to films. Cinema as such long 
        ago ceased to amaze them as a new and original phenomenon; and at the same time it is 
        expected to answer a far wider range of individual needs. Audiences have developed their
        likes and dislikes. That means that the film-maker in turn has an audience that is 
        constant, his own circle. Divergence of taste on the part of audiences can be extreme, 
        and this is in no way regrettable or alarming; the fact that people have their own 
        aesthetic criteria indicates a growth of self-awareness. Directors are going deeper 
        into the areas which concern them. There are faithful audiences and favorite directors, 
        so that there is no question of thinking in terms of unqualified success with the 
        public—that is, if one is talking about cinema not as entertainment but as art. Indeed, 
        mass popularity suggests what is known as mass culture, and not art.”

        “If we round off its date of birth, cinema can be said to be contemporary with the 
        twentieth century. That is no accident. It means that rather over eighty years ago the
        point was reached when a new muse had to emerge. Cinema was the first art form to come
        into being as a result of a technological invention, in answer to a vital need. It was
        the instrument which humanity had to have in order to increase its mastery over the 
        real world. For the domain of any art form is limited to one aspect of our spiritual 
        and emotional discovery of surrounding reality. As he buys a ticket, it’s as if the 
        cinema-goer were seeking to make up for the gaps in his own experience, throwing 
        himself into a search for ‘lost time.’ In other words he seeks to fill that spiritual
        vacuum which has formed as a result of the specific conditions of his modern existence:
        constant activity, curtailment of human contact, and the materialist bent of modern 
        education.”

        “It's impossible to create something unreal. Everything is real and unfortunately 
        we aren't able to abandon reality. We can express ourselves toward the world that 
        exists in a poetic way or a purely descriptive manner. Personally, I prefer to 
        express myself in a metaphoric way. I insist on saying metaphoric and not symbolic.
        The symbol intrinsically comprises a specific meaning, an intellectual formula, while
        the metaphor is the image itself. It's an image that possesses the same characteristics
        as the world it represents. Contrary to the symbol, its meaning is undefined. We 
        aren't able to speak about a world that is truly boundless utilizing means which 
        themselves are deflnite and restricted. We can analyze a formula, that is to say, 
        a symbol, but a metaphor is an entity unto itself, a monomial. If one tries to describe
        it, immediately it falls to pieces.”

        “The meaning of religious truth is hope. Philosophy seeks the truth, defining the 
        meaning of human activity, the limits of human reason, the meaning of existence, 
        even when the philosopher reaches the conclusion that existence is senseless, and
        human effort—futile. The allotted function of art is not, as is often assumed, to
        put across ideas, to propagate thoughts, to serve as example. The aim of art is 
        to prepare a person for death, to plough and harrow his soul, rendering it capable
        of turning to good. Touched by a masterpiece, a person begins to hear in himself 
        that same call of truth which prompted the artist to his creative act. When a link
        is established between the work and its beholder, the latter experiences a 
        sublime, purging trauma. Within that aura which unites masterpieces and audience, 
        the best sides of our souls are made known, and we long for them to be freed. In 
        those moments we recognize and discover ourselves, the unfathomable depths of our 
        own potential, and the furthest reaches of our emotions.
